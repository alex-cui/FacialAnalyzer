# Cloud-based Facial Analyzer

The Cloud-based Facial Analyzer creates a frontend website using Anglular and a backend server, Flask. The facial analyzer will attempt to take in faces from the frontend website and send it to the backend server where the faces are cropped and analyzed to guess the face's age, gender, and/or celebrity resembelance. This backend server uses cloudlab.us to host our Kubernetes cluster that holds a Docker image of this Github.
